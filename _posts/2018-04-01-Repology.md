From now on, Entware information is available at Repology, which gathers information from number of different repos and compares packages versions across them.

Repology doesn't split package information for different architectures, it brings you [meta-information about whole repo](https://repology.org/metapackages/?inrepo=entware). You can search for specific package or find out which Entware packages are unique of outdated.

_This is an example of newest packages percentage, where percentage jumped during update._
